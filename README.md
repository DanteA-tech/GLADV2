This was a practie run of all of our CPT projects that would be submitted in May. We had all frontend work and the projects were as follows, a text to binary converter. This would take the message you wrote and change it to binary numbers. There was a text to color converter, changing what you wrote into colors. There was an image to binary converter where the user uploads an image which gets converted to binary numbers. The last feature was one that tought users how binary numbers worked through the form of a guessing game.
