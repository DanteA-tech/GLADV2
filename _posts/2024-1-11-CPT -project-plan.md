# Frontend (Vance, Ashwin, and Dante)
Vance, Ashwin, and Dante would collectively strategize the implementation of both the frontend and backend for the Clash Royale deck rating website. Firstly, they would agree on a comprehensive technology stack, opting for a frontend framework like React or Vue.js to build an interactive user interface and a backend framework such as Django or Express coupled with a database system, maybe MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Vance, with a focus on user experience, would lead the frontend development, designing responsive and visually appealing UI components. Ashwin would concurrently handle the backend, creating API endpoints to interact with the database, emphasizing functionalities like deck submissions, ratings, and comments. Dante would work on seamless integration between the frontend and backend, ensuring data flow and rendering are optimized. Regular collaborative meetings, version control, and testing would be paramount to guarantee a cohesive implementation. The trioâ€™s combined efforts would result in a feature-rich Clash Royale deck rating website, blending intuitive frontend design with robust backend functionality.

# Backend (Lincoln and Gurshawn)

This website is designed for Clash Royale enthusiasts, providing a platform to select cards from the game, create personalized decks, and share them with the community. Users can publish their decks, allowing others to view, rate, and add public comments. The interactive aspect encourages strategic discussions and the exchange of ideas among players. The platform offers both light and dark modes to accommodate user preferences. Users also have the option to store their decks privately for personal use or share them publicly, contributing to the collective knowledge of Clash Royale strategies. Overall, the website serves as a hub for users to explore, rate, and discuss various Clash Royale decks, enhancing the gaming experience for the community. To enhance functionality and user interactivity, APIs are employed to fetch and display Clash Royale card data in real-time. This ensures that users can seamlessly select and integrate the latest cards into their decks. The integration of APIs also enables dynamic updates, ensuring that the platform remains current with the ever-evolving Clash Royale card pool.
