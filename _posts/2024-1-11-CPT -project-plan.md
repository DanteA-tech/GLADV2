# Frontend (Vance, Ashwin, and Dante)
Vance, Ashwin, and Dante would collectively strategize the implementation of both the frontend and backend for the Clash Royale deck rating website. Firstly, they would agree on a comprehensive technology stack, opting for a frontend framework like React or Vue.js to build an interactive user interface and a backend framework such as Django or Express coupled with a database system, maybe MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Vance, with a focus on user experience, would lead the frontend development, designing responsive and visually appealing UI components. Ashwin would concurrently handle the backend, creating API endpoints to interact with the database, emphasizing functionalities like deck submissions, ratings, and comments. Dante would work on seamless integration between the frontend and backend, ensuring data flow and rendering are optimized. Regular collaborative meetings, version control, and testing would be paramount to guarantee a cohesive implementation. The trio's combined efforts would result in a feature-rich Clash Royale deck rating website, blending intuitive frontend design with robust backend functionality.

# Backend (Lincoln and Gurshawn)
Lincoln and Gurshawn would collaboratively implement the backend of the Clash Royale deck rating website by first agreeing on a technology stack that aligns with their expertise. They might choose a backend framework like Django or Express and a database system such as PostgreSQL to store the necessary data. They would then divide responsibilities, with Lincoln focusing on user authentication, designing the Users table, and implementing secure password storage. Gurshawn would concentrate on creating API endpoints for deck submissions, ratings, and comments, ensuring these endpoints interact seamlessly with the chosen database. Regular communication and version control, perhaps using Git, would be crucial for code integration. They would prioritize data validation and security measures, and conduct thorough testing to ensure the backend functions smoothly and securely. Regular code reviews and iterations would be integral to refining the backend, allowing for a cohesive implementation of the Clash Royale deck rating website's core functionality.
