# Backend (Lincoln and Gurshawn)
Lincoln and Gurshawn would collaboratively implement the backend of the Clash Royale deck rating website by first agreeing on a technology stack that aligns with their expertise. We can do a backend framework like Django or Express and a database system such as PostgreSQL to store the necessary data. We would have user authentication, designing the Users table, and implementing secure password storage. Gurshawn would concentrate on creating API endpoints for deck submissions, ratings, and comments, ensuring these endpoints interact seamlessly with the chosen database. Regular communication and version control, perhaps using Git, would be crucial for code integration. They would prioritize data validation and security measures, and conduct thorough testing to ensure the backend functions smoothly and securely. Regular code reviews and iterations would be integral to refining the backend, allowing for a cohesive implementation of the Clash Royale deck rating website's core functionality.
