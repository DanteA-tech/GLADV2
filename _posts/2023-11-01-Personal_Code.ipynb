    "This was a search function for our passion project. It uses the online pokeapi to display information about a pokemon that a user can search for. This ended up making it to the final project as a seperete feature to the pack opening. This was HTML.\n",

    "The function of this code is to allow users to have access to a database with all the pokemon, so they can learn about them and see what they look like. It is good for people who dont have good knowlege of pokemon along with people who do."
