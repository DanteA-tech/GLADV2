    "# Plan For Quiz\n",
    "For this quiz, in order to prepare, I plan on reviewing each of the team teaches(accesible through my student each blog page) and read/go through them to solodify my understading on each one. Then, if I still have questions, I will go to college board and watch the vieos for better support. I will go through the quiz and write down the questions I needed help on and write a sentence or two on why is was difficult and what I learned from it. Sort of like a quick reflection on each of the problems I couldnâ€™t do.\n",

    "- Pseudocode: Pseudocode is a way to represent an algorithm using a mix of natural language and simplified programming constructs. It's used to describe the logic of a program without writing full code.\n",
